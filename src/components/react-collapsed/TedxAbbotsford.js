          - Worked with a team of six to build a web based application using
          React with the MERN stack. The web application was a tool to help
          musicians find more job opportunities during Covid.
          <br /> <br /> - Designed algorithms for optimizing the client-musician
          pairing system, finding the best possible match by conditions such as
          distance, pricing, etc.
          <br /> <br /> - Implemented APIâ€™s for services such as Google Maps,
          distance calculation, and automated email deployment.
          <br /> <br /> - Project placed 2nd out of 19 others from majority
          votes by students, sponsors, and faculty.
